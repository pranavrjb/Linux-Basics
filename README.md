# 🐧 Linux Learning Journal – Week 1

Hi there! 👋  
This repo contains everything I learned during my **first week of exploring Linux** as part of my **DevOps journey**.  
I practiced commands on my Ubuntu VM and took notes along the way. Hope this helps other beginners too!

- Linux directories: `/`, `/root`, `/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr`, etc.

- Editors: `vim`, `less`, `more`
